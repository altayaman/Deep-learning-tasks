This folder has trained word2vec models. Models are trained on sampled descriptionary which are coming from
"/train data from descriptionary nodes by sampling/3 - Picking samples from each node/" folder.

#1
Trained models are stored in folders with names "model_word2vect_ ..." enumerated. Each folder should contain trained model and the python code that generated the model itself. The folder names also contain some additional meta info about trained models. 

For ex: 
vec64 means word embedding vector length is 64.
win1 means window size for training was 1.
dict_sample_5000 means model was trained on descriptionary sample 5000 (e.g. 5000 items were took from each descriptionary node).

#2
The "codes" folder just contains the code for training word2vec models.
